If we use 3DSMax without Flipping Normals checked when importing .OBJ file,
the original normals from wm0.map are inverted.
This is the way to go, but the mesh gets dark in 3DSMax.
To see the mesh, you must go to Rendering->Environment (shortcut key 8) and
in 'Global Lightning' section, use a WHITE color in 'Ambient' part.
